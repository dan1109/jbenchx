<h1>Rules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Benchmark classes must have a no-arg public constructor.</li>
<li>Benchmark methods must be public.</li>
<li>Benchmark methods must not take arguments.</li>
<li>Benchmark methods can return values.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Annotations:</h1>

<h2>@Bench</h2>
Each benchmark methods must be annotated with the @Bench annotation.
Each method which has this annotation or one of its overridden method
of super class contains this annotation is considered a benchmark method
of the class.<p>
The @Bench annotation also allows to specify certain parameters for the benchmark.
If some option is not set, the option's value is taken from the overridden method of
the super-class or if the method is not an overriding method, the default
value for the option is chosen.

<h3>Parameters:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>minRunCount</b>: Minimum number of runs that are performed for benchmarking the method.</li>
<li><b>maxRunCount</b>: Maximum number of runs that are performed for benchmarking the method.</li>
<li><b>minSampleCount</b>: Minimum number of valid samples that are needed.</li>
<li><b>maxDeviation</b>: Maximum deviation from the minimal time allowed to consider a sample valid.</li>
<li><b>divisor</b>: Benchmark value divisor. The measured time is divided by this value.</li>
<li><b>targetTimeNs</b>: Target time for a single run of the benchmark.</li>
</ul>


<h2>@SingleRun</h2>
If a benchmark method gets annotated with the @SingleRun annotation,
the benchmark will be invoked only once during a benchmark run instead
of calculating the iteration count based on the target time.
If you use this annotation you must ensure yourself that the benchmark runs
a meaningful amouth of time.


<h2>@Group</h2>
The @Group annotation allows the benchmark class to be associated to
a certain benchmark group. The group is identified by the string given
to the annotation.
