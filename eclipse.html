The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> plug-in
enables you to run benchmarks directly from within
eclipse.

Important note: Before you can write JBenchX bechmarks in 
Eclipse you need to add the JBenchX library to the classpath! You can do this
easily by opening the Properties of your project, selecting the Java Build Path
page, chosing the Libraries tab and adding the JBenchX libraries with the
"Add Library..." command.
